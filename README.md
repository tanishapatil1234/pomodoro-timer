The Pomodoro Timer is a simple web application that helps users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. This technique breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The timer offers customizable options, allowing users to select different time intervals for work sessions (Pomodoro), short breaks, and long breaks.

## Features:
- **Customizable Timer:** Choose between Pomodoro (1 hour), Short Break (10 minutes), and Long Break (35 minutes) intervals.
- **Background Selection:** Select background images to create a personalized ambiance while working.
- **Intuitive Interface:** User-friendly interface with easy-to-use buttons for starting and resetting the timer.
- **Embedded Spotify Playlist:** Enjoy background music during work sessions by embedding your favorite Spotify playlist directly into the app.

The Pomodoro Timer is perfect for boosting productivity, staying focused, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
